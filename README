neutro is a damn simple module installer for Perl 6.

It currently does not resolve dependencies, but besides it works
pretty well.

Patches, ideas and criticism welcome.

Usage:
./neutro http://github.com/tadzik/perl6-Acme-Meow

TODO:
Dependency handling.
Installing modules by name, not only by url.
Compiling to PIR.
