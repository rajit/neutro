neutro is a module installer for Perl 6.
It's a temporary working solution, while experts build
the Real Deal (proto, pls). The difference is that neutro works :)

It uses its own database (based on proto's one) using
the actual module names (like Acme::Meow) rather than
github's repo names (like perl6-Acme-Meow).

It probably won't work on anything besides Unixes.

Patches, ideas and criticism welcome.

Usage:
./neutro l
./neutro i Acme::Meow
